# DropTune : Over-the-Air Music Player

*Ever wanted to play music in your TV or Music System that does not support over-the-air, but you are too lazy to write songs into a USB?*

Well, **DropTune** is your buddy here.

Upload songs from one device and have it played in another device.

##### "Inspiration"
###### I had a Raspberry Pi 2 Model A which had no Wi-Fi module but can connect to internet by using tethering from an old Nokia. But the internet was slow, and the Pi cannot handle quite heavy pieces of software. Hence, this.

## Usage
DropTune has two modes: DJ and Player, to drop a song for playback, and to play the dropped song, respectively.

### Prerequisites

Requires python3 and pip3 installed in the Laptop/PC.

## Installation

Download this repo as zip and extract

OR

```git clone https://github.com/GameGodS3/DropTune.git```
